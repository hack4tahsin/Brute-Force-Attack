# Brute Force Attack
A brute force attack is a trial-and-error method used to decode sensitive data. The most common applications for brute force attacks are cracking passwords and cracking encryption keys.

# How Do Brute Force Attacks Work
A brute force attack is both a specific attack method and a broad category of similar attacks. Variation occurs in where hackers start and how they make their attempts. As mentioned earlier, hackers can use manual processes or automated software to infiltrate a private network. Additionally, hackers may already have access to certain information before they begin their attempts.

For example, in a method known as "reverse brute force attacks," the hacker already has a list of passwords for brute force downloaded from the dark web and is attempting to match them with a username for access. Alternatively, in another type called "credential stuffing," the hacker already has the correct credentials for one website, user account, or other system and attempts to use them on others.
